SQL For : Data Cleaning RFM Analysis

Python script for: KMeans clustering Segment labeling Visualization

Power BI Dashboard (.pbix file)

📌 Key Features RFM Aggregation & Clustering using KMeans Custom segment labeling using business logic

Clean, interactive Power BI dashboard with: KPIs (Avg Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Bar Charts (Segment-wise customers) Scatter Plot (Monetary vs Frequency) Segment-wise Insights
